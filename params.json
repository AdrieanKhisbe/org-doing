{"name":"Org-doing","tagline":"keep track of what you're doing right now and what you've worked on before","body":"# org-doing\r\n\r\nInspired by [doing](https://github.com/ttscoff/doing/), a set of\r\nfunctions for keeping track of what you're doing right now.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nCreates a `doing.org` file in your home directory (or wherever\r\n`org-doing-file` points to). The file has two sections: now and\r\nlater. The now section lists things you are currently working on. The\r\nlater section lists things you want to work on later.\r\n\r\n## Use it\r\n\r\n### Org-Doing Functions\r\n\r\nLog what you're doing now:\r\n\r\n    M-x org-doing-log\r\n\r\nLog what you're doing later:\r\n\r\n    C-u M-x org-doing-log\r\n\r\nLog something you've already done:\r\n\r\n    M-x org-doing-done\r\n\r\nMark your most recent TODO as DONE:\r\n\r\n    M-x org-doing-done\r\n    (don't enter anything and press Enter)\r\n\r\n### Org-Doing Omni Function\r\n\r\nThe omni function lets you enter short-hands at the beginning, making it very quick to use org-doing:\r\n\r\n    M-x org-doing\r\n    now reviewing email, getting ready for a nap. seriously\r\n\r\nThe \"now\" is parsed and the `org-doing-log` function is called with\r\nthe rest of the string. It's the same as doing this:\r\n\r\n    M-x org-doing-log\r\n    reviewing email, getting ready for a nap. seriously\r\n\r\nThis is also works for later and for done:\r\n\r\n    M-x org-doing\r\n    later adding more cool features to org-doing mode\r\n    \r\n    M-x org-doing\r\n    done added something simply amazing to org-doing mode\r\n\r\n    M-x org-doing\r\n    done\r\n\r\n## From The Bash Command-Line\r\n\r\nYou can also use org-doing from the command line by defining the\r\n`ORG_DOING_PATH` environment variable to the location of\r\n`org-doing.el` and by sourcing `org-doing.bash`:\r\n\r\n    ORG_DOING_PATH=/path/to/org-doing.el\r\n    source /path/to/org-doing.bash\r\n    doing now awesome stuff\r\n    doing later more awesome\r\n    doing done something cool\r\n    doing done\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
